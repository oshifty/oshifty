## 🔨 Making SHIFTY Work

The most important thing for us **now** is to dig deep and do the hard work to bring SHIFTY to life. For this, we need to inspire others — people and companies alike — to support the cause 🙌. We need your feedback, ideas, and contributions to features, and we need you to test the existing stuff we've already built 🛠️.

After the initial groundwork is laid, it becomes increasingly important to test SHIFTY in real-world scenarios 🌍. We'll start by taking it to small shows where any issues can be easily mitigated, allowing us to gather real-world data on performance, stability, and most importantly, usability 📊.

Once we confirm SHIFTY works in these environments, we can begin using it for bigger events 🎪, gradually increasing the scale until we're confident enough to say: "SHIFTY is ready for prime time and will deliver on the biggest shows worldwide!" 🌟

At this point, we can pat ourselves on the back 👏. We've achieved a lot from a technical standpoint. But this isn't the end of the journey.

## 🚀 Making SHIFTY Popular

Now that we've validated that SHIFTY works, we need to make it big 🌠. The advantages in user experience will truly benefit users only when SHIFTY has widespread adoption.

To implement our solutions in the market as soon as possible, it's worthwhile to make use of **standardization** 📏. Standardization is part of technical regulation and serves several key purposes:

- **Confirmation of necessity**: Ensures that the requirements aren't already covered by another standard ✅.
- **Interoperability**: Makes sure that solutions are universal enough to work hand in hand with existing systems 🤝.
- **Dissemination**: Eases the way for market players to adopt new solutions 🚚.

As margins in the event industry are very low — around 10% 💰 — it's crucial for companies to operate efficiently. Standards form the basis for this efficiency, as working with standardized solutions is often cheaper not only in terms of purchasing hardware but also in terms of usage due to economies of scale 📈.

By focusing on standardization, we can ensure that SHIFTY will not only work but also thrive in the market, making lighting design a breeze for everyone involved 🌈.
